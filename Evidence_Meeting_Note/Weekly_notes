General 
Meeting every Thursdays at 2pm in Appleton  
Task for next week:
Create a documents for minutes 
Create a documents for models we are interested in
Find 1 to 2 of models interested in
Library of models coMSES 
Netlogo model library 
System dynamics society 
doesn’t need to have journal article written on 
Bullet point out a “patterns and purposes” section 
Things to keep in mind
Modifications and analysis must be based in realism 
Do improvements don’t justification from articles
WEEK 7 Meeting Notes
31st October meeting 14.00 -16.33  (all members present)

1-2 side project summary for formative (non-graded) feedback – aims, purpose and patterns, outline methods, experiments to be run

Task for next week:

Read paper
Add thoughts concerns and experiments to the document 
Discuss on whats app 
Add couple bullet 
Get someone/chatgpt to write it out in full


WEEK 8 meeting Notes
7th November meeting 14.00 - 17.33

Coding the other milks into the model
Begin the Simulation analysis
Compose appropriate graphs 

8th November meeting 12.00 - 19.30
Got model to work with multiple milks


WEEK 9 dea



1.)  Adding in all the milks

Add all the variables for new milks 

Create methods to sum the milks for the Milk choice graph and Average consumption

Create new graphs for different milk growths 

WEEK 9 meeting Notes
14th November 14.00 - 18.00
15th November 12.00 - 18.30


GOALS for Week 10 
Write up all the report
Formulation and implementation
Experiments Results analysis Discussion ….
ODD (emphasise on how complex our model is)

Data gathering
get realistic data that works in health/env-sums MAKE UP NUMBERS (relatively)

Behaviour space working 
Show how varying our different parameters affect our outcome of the best milk
Impact tracker working
Show that environmental and health increases (environmentally friendly and healthier)  



Things to do tmr: 

Run the model to get results + find out which parameters are most influential and adjust accordingly : social parameters, means of env + health, marketing campaign, running the model for different means of the health score, (Health, environmental tracker)
Health,  environmental tracker
Data analysis: Composing visualisations for results to interpret 
Fix the marketing campaign feature 
write-up report: ODD + main body 






Things to do 23/11/2024:


Decide on parameters
Run the models with predefined parameters - best to run on multiple computers 
Visualisation for data to analyse on model analysis + exp section 
Healthiest/Environmentally-Friendly milk should come out on top regardless of community type 
Take means of different types milk quantities
Plot a chart which shows what milks “won” in each simulations
Statistical analysis to be determined

Write-up of rest of the report 
Presentation draft + potential Q&A prep



Things to do: 24/11/2024
Create data visualisation (refer to Bspace + data visualisation Tab) - Sunday 
Focus on writing the result analysis section of the report with graph - Monday 
Finalise report (Discussion, further work etc) + Presentation draft + practice-Tuesday
Finalise report (finish off what’s left + reference check) + finalise pre slides + QA- Wednesday
Report refine + presentation day - Thursday
Report submission @12:00pm - Friday 



We are really too panicked to finish the meeting notes with much coherence but we have met at least 6 times for an average of 8 hours per meeting
